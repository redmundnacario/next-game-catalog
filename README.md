<br />

Libraries/Tech used

- NextJS, ReactJS
- useContext for cleaner code and state management

- sass and css modules
- jest and react testing library for unit testing

What could you do better in your code next iteration?

- completes code coverage
- implements separate backend to showcase backend skill
- completes targets. Some of the target features were not implemented due to time constraint

Any other notes you feel relevant for the evaluation of your solution.

- consider the days of implementation. If there are more days I can do more. :)
- usage of typescript, and useContext
- created react hooks
- CSS / SCSS - created mixins for mobile responsiveness
- reused some components like button, dropdown, and page shell
- testing - mocking of useRouter, function
- configuration of eslint, prettier, and husky for linting, formatting, ang git hook
- deployment :) Please see link
